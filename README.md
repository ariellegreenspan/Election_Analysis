     ## Election-Audit Summary:
          This script can be used for any election since it allows analysts to determine an assortment of data about local elections. From this script, one can determine         how many voters participated in the election, how many voters voted for specific candidates, the percentage of voters that voted for specific candidates, the number        of voters per county, the percentage of voters per county, the winner of the election, and the county that had the largest number of voters. One suggestion to              modify the script would be look at additional parameters of the voter population aside from county residence. This script can be modified in the future to look at          the age percentage of the voter population, to give an idea if choice of candidate varies by age of voter. One could also modify the script to determine political          party affiliation of candidates and voters. This would enable analysts to determine which political parties dominate in the election, and which political parties          have a larger percentage of voters per county.
